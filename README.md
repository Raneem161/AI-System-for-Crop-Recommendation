# AI-System-for-Crop-Recommendation

## Overview
This project focuses on developing an AI system for recommending suitable crops based on environmental and soil conditions, focusing on its potential application in Jordan. The project includes data collection from an existing dataset, AI methods' employment, specifically random forest and neural network models, using different frameworks and tools for implementation, including Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. Regarding the model implementation pipeline: the models were constructed and refined, and different performance measures were used for evaluation, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC curve. Finally, the results were presented and discussed, including the feasibility of implementing the system in Jordan, suggesting that while the models performed well, collecting relevant data for Jordanian crops is a crucial next step.
